# tlm/oceandynamics

This module produces thermal expansion and dynamic sea level projections. Thermal expansion is derived from inputted surface air temperature and ocean heat content projections provided from a climate model emulator. Dynamic sea level is estimated based on the correlation between thermal expansion and local dynamic sea level in the CMIP6 multimodel ensemble. See IPCC AR6 WG1 9.SM.4.2 and 9.SM.4.3.
