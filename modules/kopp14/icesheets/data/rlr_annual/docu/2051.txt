This is a new station first data 2009. Data has previously been supplied but latitude and
longitude only now confirmed. Benchmark HI1 4.342m relative to datum REDMAR
Station made RLR. RLR year 2006 factor 5.458m.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 18-Mar-2013 :
The Aanderra pressure gauge at Hierro has been moved and replaced by a new MIROS
radar sensor. Both old and new gauges were operating for the period 14.11.2009-
15.06.2010 for inter-comparison purposes. During this period a bias (mean difference) between the two
gauges was calculated as -0.29cm. A malfunction in the old sensor was also detected.
There was also a datum change of -9cm from Nov. 2011.
See B. Perez et al paper 'Overlapping sea level time series
measured using different technologies: an example from the REDMAR Spanish
network'.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 13-Jan-2014 :
Further investigation revealed that the bias was due to a fault in the old Pressure gauge. Data from this was revised. Complete dataset was re-entered into database.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 28-Apr-2014 :
At the request of Puerto del Estado the latitude and longitude have been changed from 27.800000 -17.898333 derived from the previously supplied degrees and minutes value to 27.78408 -17.90163 which is the position of the new MIROS gauge in decimal degrees.
