Following the revised way of recording the height of sea level at this station to recording upwards rather than downwards there is now an anomaly with the datum. Although the values of TGZ have been questioned several times the HNHS are adament they are correct.Because of this the station was flagged and reverted from RLR status to 'Metric' from June 2002 onwwards. However the station retains the RLR status so that the good RLR data is available on the database.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 13-Jul-2011 :
Following further information received from the Hellenic Navy Oceanographic Service the datum problem now seems to be resolved. The plotted data now appears correct. Therefore the station flag has been removed and all of the data reinstated as RLR.
