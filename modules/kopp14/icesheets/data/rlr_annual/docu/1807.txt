A paper by Marcos et al (JGR Volume 11, 2005) provides an overview
of the tide gauge records on the northern coast of Spain.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 1999Aug20 :
Gauge type=SONAR acoustic
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 18-Mar-2013 :
The SRD acoustic gauge at Santander has been replaced by a new MIROS radar sensor. Both old and new gauges were running in parallel for the period 6.02.2008-17.03.2009 for inter-comparison purposes. A bias (mean difference) of -0.76cm was calculated between the two gauges. See paper by B. Perez et al 'Overlapping sea level time series measured using different technologies: an example from the REDMAR Spanish network'
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 13-Jan-2014 :
With further investigation it became apparent to Puertos del Estado that the bias detected between old and new datasets was an indication of problems with the old Acoustic gauge. Data from the old gauge has been revised to account for this. Whole dataset has been re-entered onto the database.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 28-Apr-2014 :   
At the request of Puertos del Estado the latitude and longitde have been changed from 43.366667 -3.783333 which related to the old SRD gauge to 43.46130 -3.79076 which is the new MIROS gauge.
