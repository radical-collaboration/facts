Data prior to 1902 are unreliable as the zero point was not stable.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 21-Mar-2012 :
Previously the data values for Goteborg-Ringon were included with those for
Goteborg-Klippan. However, the SMHI treat the two stations separately. A
decision was made to mirror the SMHI website and separate the two datasets.
