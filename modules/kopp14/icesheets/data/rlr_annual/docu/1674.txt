For an analysis of sea level changes in Hong Kong, see "Sea level changes in Hong Kong from tide gauge measurements" by X.Ding et al., Journal of Geodesy, 74, 683-689, 2001 and "Long-term sea-level changes in Hong Kong from tide-gauge records" by X.Ding et al., Journal of Coastal Research,17, 749-754, 2001.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 1998Oct07 :
This station Quarry Bay replaced station North Point (611/011) from 1986.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 1999Dec03 :
According to Dr.Baki Iz (Hong Kong Polytechnic University) reference benchmarks at the North Point and Quarry Bay gauges show from episodic levelling significant settlement with respect
to neighbouring marks (October 1998). However, data provided for these sites are conventionally referred to the more stable Principal Datum and Rifleman's Bolt benchmark by means of frequent levelling. Note that the North Point and Quarry Bay datums are the same and their RLR time series may be combined to make one continuous record if wished with reasonable confidence.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 1999Dec03 :
Quarry Bay, HK      611/010 RLR(1975, NP) is 11.2m below Rifleman's Bolt
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 12-Jul-2010 :   
As no data exists for 1975 from Quarry Bay (see comments above) to produce an updated RLR diagram from the database an alternative year was selected. The RLR was generated using 1986 as the RLR year. This does not alter any of the relevant numbers and the RLR factor remains 5.619. RLR (1986) also remains 11.2m below the Fundamental Bench Mark (Rifleman's Bolt).
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 03-Aug-2016 :   
Using information from the datasheet the height for the Primary benchmark to the TGZ has been revised from 5.581m to 5.580m. As a result the RLR factor has changed from 5.619m to 5.62m
