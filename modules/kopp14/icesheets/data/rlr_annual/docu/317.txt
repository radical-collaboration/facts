Bulgarian sea levels likely to be heavily influenced by river flow.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 27-AUG-97 :
The site of the tide gauge is subject to subsidence.  During the period
1929-95 the datum of observations has sunk 0.244m
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 1999Mar10 :
In March 1999 a 'buddy checking' test was performed by Tsimplis
and Woodworth on the following 6 Black Sea stations in the RLR
data set at the time, in order to check out some apparent
west-east differences in the MSL values:
295021R Bourgas     Bulgaria
295051R Varna       ..
297021R Constantza  Romania
300001R Tuapse      Russia
305021R Poti        Georgia
305031R Batumi      ..
It seems that Varna, Tuapse and Batumi seem basically 'ok' except
that after about 1985 Tuapse and Batumi start to increase
relative to Varna. The increase of Tuapse is about 10 cm relative
to the western ones, that of Batumi is more like 20.
Bourgas compared to Varna seems 'ok' as well except there is a
period around 1950-55 when Bourgas is relatively low by about 8 cm.
Also Constantza is ok relative to Varna if a large dip in Constantza
around 1980-85 and a datum shift around 1948 are taken out.  Tuapse
minus Constantza shows the rise from about 1985 again.
For Poti, it is very hard to see what is going on given the large
background trend. It has a clear large fall in 1960's though.
In conclusion, it seems that the recent west-east changes must be
real? And as Tuapse and Batumi have different increases relative
to the west presumably the effect is in the east?  Are there
levelling (datum) concerns we are not aware of?  Recent changes
to local rivers?
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 2000Jan25 :
Bourgas             295/021 RLR(1995) is 11.5m below BM no. 12
Bourgas is an historic station last data 1996.
