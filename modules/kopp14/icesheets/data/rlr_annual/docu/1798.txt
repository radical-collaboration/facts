This year, rather than just sending the latest year of data the complete dataset has been supplied. This has highlighted some differences in the data. From communications in the correspondence file for 2002 it appears that the Oceans and Fisheries meant to supply revised data for the stations supplied. This did not happen. The complete dataset includes these data revisions. Therefore, the whole dataset has now been re-entered.
One isolated datapoint for May 1985 has been switched to Metric.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 11-Aug-2016 :   
Using information from the Fishersies and Oceans website the RLR diagram has been re-drawn> Primary benchmark is now 85L9355 5.014m above Chart Datum
