Data for Vise 1953-2000 were previously on the database these values were
copied and stored in a box file on the top of one of the PSMSL roller front
cupboards. Revised data values for
1953-2009 were downloaded from the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute
website these were loaded onto the database. The RLR factor remains 7.000m as
before.

Following the recent download of data it was noted that some of the historic values differed slightly. Because of this the whole dataset has been re-loaded.
