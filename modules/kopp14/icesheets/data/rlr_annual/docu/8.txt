=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 09-JUL-92 :
GAUGES IN EASTERN GERMANY (WISMAR, WARNEMUNDE, SASSNITZ, KOSEROW) AS
OF MARCH 1992 ARE TYPE 'STEREMAT', VERTICAL DRUM, SWIMMER PRINCIPLE,
MEASURES 1:10, CONTINUOUS REGISTRATION ON PAPER CHART. (INFORMATION
FROM L.BALLANI, POTSDAM).
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 02-AUG-94 :
These values are of Wismar MSL relative to the HN datum as
computed by the University of Dresden. See the report
"Die Reduktion historischer Wasserstandsmessungen an der Kueste
Mecklenburg-Vorpommerns auf das Hoehensystem HN76" by
G.Liebsch, R.Dietrich, L.Ballani and G.Langer.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 29-SEP-94 :
Prior to 1894 readings from tide pole.  1894 analogue gauge installed.
1945-52 tide pole while new gauge installed. Dresden analyses based on:
1848-1882 1 reading per day, corrected for tidal effects
1883-1894(June) 4 readings per day, corrected for tidal effects
1894(July)-1945 4 readings per day from charts
1946-1952 1 to 4 readings per day, corrected for tidal effects
1953-1980 4 readings per day
So, tidal aliasing effects should be largely removed from Desden values
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 2002Jan23 :
Wismar data up to 1992 supplied by Technische Universitat
Dresden (auth=H3).  Data 1993- supplied by Bundesamt fur Seeschiffahrt
und Hydrographie (BSH), Hamburg (auth=16).
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 09-Aug-2010 :   
The data for Wismar was measured to Normal Null which is a German datum related
to Potsdam near Berlin. It is similar to ODN in the UK or NAP in Holland. It is
unusual therefore to relate the data to RLR as it 'breaks the rules' of RLR.
Data now refers to TGZ.
