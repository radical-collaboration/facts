All records from approximately Maisaka (642/126) to Kushimoto (642/141) show large rates of rise of sea level, with large falls around 1980. Several factors might be at work. Emery and Aubrey (Sea Levels, Land Levels and Tide Gauges. Springer-Verlag. 1991. page 37) point to submergence caused by withdrawal of groundwater in the Nagoya area. In addition, Professor Minoru Odamaki informs us that sea levels in the area are well known to be affected by Kuroshio meanders. This is reported in Tsumura Kenshiro (1963) :" Investigation of the Mean Sea Level and its Variation along the Coast of Japan (Part I) ", Journal of Geodetical Society Japan, vol 9, 49-90,( in Japanese, with English abstract) and recently Kawabe M. (1980) : Sea level variations along the south coast of Japan and the large Meander in the Kuroshio. J. Oceanopgraphical Soc. Japan,36, 97-104.
