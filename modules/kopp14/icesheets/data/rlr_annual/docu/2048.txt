=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 24-Jan-2011 :
This is a newly entered station. Although data has previously been supplied
latitude and longitude were unknown. Station made RLR. RLR year is 2004 factor
5.488m.
Benchmark is SSMARE 3.812m relative to REDMAR datum and 2.807m relative to IGN.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 09-Apr-2013 :
The Aanderaa pressure gauge at Fuerteventura has been moved to a different position in the harbour and replaced by a new MIROS radar gauge. Both old and new gauges were running in parallel for the period 1.12.2009- 07.02.2011.for inter-comparison purposes. A bias (mean difference) of 4.25cm was found between the two gauges. See paper B. Perez et al 'Overlapping sea level time series measured using different technologies: an example from the REDMAR Spanish network'
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 13-Jan-2014 :
Further investigation revealed that the bias was due to a problem with the old pressure gauge. Data from this has been revised. Complete dataset was re-entered onto the database.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 29-Apr-2014 :
At the request of Puertos del Estado the latitude and longitude have been revised from 28.500000 -13.851667 derived from the previously supplied degrees and minutes value to 28.49251 -13.85822 which is the site of the new MIROS gauge in decimal degrees.
