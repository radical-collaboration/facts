=========================== BENCHMARK INFORMATION UPDATE ADDED  12-JUL-93 :
Cananeia            874/051 RLR(1984) is 9.4m below BM RN S/No Cota=2.465
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 10-DEC-96 :
Although this station evidentally has a large apparent rate of rise of sea level, it has operated in the same location throughout,and annual site levellings show no differential movements in the immediate vicinty of the gauge.  The large rate maybe connected to the geology of the nearby mountain to the SW, while the large interannual variability may be a result of the estuary location. (Information from Prof.A.de Mesquita, Univ. of Sao Paulo).
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 2002Nov11 :
Cananeia datums are suspect due to Tide Staff slippage, probably in 1989.  RLR is given as a constant correction but there is a datum difference of approx. 5cms after 1989.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 20-Apr-2007 :
