=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 18-Aug-2011 :
Using data from the Canadian Hydrographic Service the RLR diagram has been
re-drawn. The Primary benchmark remains BM CHS -4 1984 but has now been given
its official name CHS 4-1984 as appears on their website.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 27-Jul-2015 :
This year, rather than just sending the latest year of data, the complete dataset has been supplied. This has highlighted some differences in the data. From communications in the correspondence file for 2002 it appears that the Oceans and Fisheries meant to supply revised data for the stations supplied. This did not happen. The complete dataset includes these data revisions. Therefore, the whole dataset has now been re-entered.
