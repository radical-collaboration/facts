=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 21-Feb-2012 :
A massive earthquake of magnitude 9.0 occurred on Friday 11th March 2011 with the epicentre approx. 70km east of the Oshika Peninsula of Tohoku. It was the most powerful known earthquake to hit Japan and triggered a tsunami with waves up to 40.5m and travelling up to 10km inland. It looks as if the earthquake badly damaged the tide gauge at Onahama as there is a jump and then it stops working in July 2011. Data following the earthquake has been flagged.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 04-Feb-2013 :
There have over the years been a number of different benchmarks because of space restrictions not all are included on the RLR diagram. Where two or more benchmarks have the same name the later are suffixed. Throughout the RLR factor has remained the same.
