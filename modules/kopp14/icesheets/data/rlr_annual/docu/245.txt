=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 25-Aug-2011 :
Using NOAA data the RLR diagram has been re-drawn. Primary benchmark remains BM8 5.361m above gauge datum but has now been given its official title 8 -14FT ABOVE MLLW to agree with the NOAA website.
For information: Data values during the 1980's can look high. This could be due to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) as it is mirrored along the Californian coast.
