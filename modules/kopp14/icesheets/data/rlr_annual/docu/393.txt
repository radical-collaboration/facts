=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 23-MAR-94 :
data up to 1992 revised, March 1994
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 15-JUL-94 :
St John's           970/121 RLR(1992) is 10.0m below BM 90F9000

=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 05-Dec-2006 :
Revised historical data 1935-7, 1942 supplied 17th April 2001. This was confirmed to be the same datum as 1957-
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 06-Mar-2008 :
Data 2004 flagged suspect. However, when buddy checked with 2 local stations the dip is apparent in these also. The flagging has been removed.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 18-Aug-2011 :
Using data from the Canadian Hydrographic service the RLR diagram has been re-drawn. Primary benchmark remains 90F9000 at 3.808m above Chart Datum. Benchmark 76-F-727 is also still in use.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 27-Jul-2015 :
This year, rather than just sending the latest year of data, the complete dataset has been supplied. This has highlighted some differences in the data. From communications in the correspondence file for 2002 it appears that the Oceans and Fisheries meant to supply revised data for the stations supplied. This did not happen. The complete dataset includes these data revisions. Therefore, the whole dataset has now been re-entered.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 30-Jul-2015 :
Historic data was included in the above complete dataset. The datum for the period 1935-1942 is currently being queried. Until the Fisheries and Oceans Canada confirm the datum this data has been made Metric.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 28-Jun-2016 :
It has been confirmed by the Canadian Authority that the datum for the historic data for 1935-1942 is CD as the rest of the data. The historic data has been added to the RLR data. However, the 1935-1937 data was 'corrected to zero of the diagram' and 1.29ft subtracted from the data to convert it to CD
