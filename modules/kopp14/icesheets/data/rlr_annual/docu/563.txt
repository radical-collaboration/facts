Prior to 1970 data supplied by Negociado de Hidrografia, Havana
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 2002Oct23 :
Gibara              930/031 RLR(1994) is 7.956m below TGBM
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 26-Aug-2010 :
Although an RLR factor existed Gibara was never actually an RLR station. Gibara has now been created an RLR station with RLR factor 5.032m.Both the benchmark and the TGZ are related to the Geodesic National Datum (GND). TGBM DATUM is 1.148m relative to GND while TGZ is -0.92m relative to GND. Data is referred to TGZ. Early data 1949-1972 has been left as 'Metric' as datum of the early data in unknown.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 03-Mar-2016 :
To reflect the fact that the monthly means supplied refer to TGZ and not GND the RLR diagram has been redrawn. As a result the RLRFAC has changed fron 5.032m to 6.032m. RLR (2008) is now 8.1m below TGBM DATUM.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 29-Jun-2016 :   
Information received from Cuba the tide gauge sensors are listed as from 1970 a float recording hourly and from 2013 a datalogger cuopled to the float with 6 minute frequency.
