=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 1999Nov22 :
The Port Stanley float gauge (Lea company) was installed in
November 1964 as an arrangement between Fuchs and Irving around 1963.
It was run by the Colonial Office to about 1975 but the quality of
the records from 1970 is said to be poor. It was located inside the
conference room at the west end of the Government Jetty in Stanley
Harbour and still existed in some condition up to 1982. The tide
gauge zero was Chart Datum which was 20.53 feet below the BM on
the PWD Office.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 1999Dec06 :
The RLR datums for both Stanley I (863/001) and Stanley II (863/002)
have been set to be 10.7 m below benchmark A which is the same as 12.83 m below
the PWD Office BM. The two RLR series can be combined if required
although there is a large passage of time between them.
