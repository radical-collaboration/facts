Cebu has been 'buddy checked' with Surigao. Cebu has what appears to be suspect data for the period Aug 1973-Feb 1975 and again Dec 1997-Dec 1999. Data for Surigao does not start until May 1987 but there is a similar sea level profile for the period Dec 1997-Dec 1999. Because of this the data has not been flagged. Gauge type is AXSYS
