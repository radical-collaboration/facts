Algeciras 2 is a new station first data 2009 and is part of the new REDMAR network.
Gauge is a MIROS radar sensor. Initially hardware problems (de-lamination) were
encountered. Also there was a change of -14.3cm to the datum from Jan. 2010 these have been
accounted for in the supplied data. Benchmark NGAB-MAR CEPSA is 3.297m relative
to REDMAR datum and 2.776m relative to IGN. See paper B. Perezet al
'Overlapping sea level time series measured using different technologies:
an example from the REDMAR Spanish network'.
