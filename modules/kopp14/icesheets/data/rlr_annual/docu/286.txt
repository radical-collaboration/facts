Immingham           170/061 RLR(1964) is 12.0m below BMTA1989 1630
=========================== BENCHMARK INFORMATION UPDATE ADDED  12-JUL-93 :

Palatine gauge 1910 onwards.  In September 1954 a Munro stilling well
gauge was installed, replaced by another Munro in October 1962.
From June 1986 the gauge has been an "A class" bubbler system.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 15-Nov-2006 :
Historic tide gauge information: New datalogger fitted November 2000.
A mid-tide sensor was installed in June 2004 with this the levelling was
checked and found to be in error. Data for the period 2000-2004 was adjusted
by 38mm to correct for this and the statistics re-calculated.
Immingham tide gauge is situated within the Humber Estuary and so is
influenced by density variations caused by the effect of fresh water flow.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 03-Jul-2014 :
TGI were at site 13.11.2013 for general maintenance. On 07.12.2013 the port was flooded which caused power failure resulting in power loss to the whole site. TGI returned to the site 12.12 2013 to reinstate the power and change the compressor. The site had flooded to a depth of approximately 350mm.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 18-May-2015 :   
There were pressure problems at site during January and February and again from August 2014 onwards. TGI made three visits to the gauge during the year.
