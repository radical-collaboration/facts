=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 09-Aug-2010 :   
The data for Kiel-Holtenau was measured to PN = NN-500cm
Normal depth of PN=500cm.
Normal Null(NN)is a German datum
related to levels at Potsdam near Berlin. It is similar to ODN in the UK and
the NAP in Holland. It is unusual therefore that the German stations have been
made RLR as it 'breaks the rules' of RLR. Data now refers to TGZ.
