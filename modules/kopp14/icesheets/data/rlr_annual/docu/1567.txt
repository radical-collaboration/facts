=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 2003Nov17 :
This data was formerly under KOCHI II (644/002). The station was replaced in 1983 after 2 years without data. Although the datum information seems to show continuity with KOCHI II (linked through Tokyo Peil), the time-series clearly shows a datum shift and so has been moved to a new time-series.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 05-May-2009 :
Seems to be a slight rise in the dataset after the gap in 2001-2002.
