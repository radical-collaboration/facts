=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 23-MAY-05 :
A paper by Marcos et al (JGR Volume 11, 2005) provides an overview
of the tide gauge records on the northern coast of Spain.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 2000Oct19 :
Vigo II, new station 1997.  Data supplied by Climat Maritimo, Madrid.
RLR(1997) is 11.039m below BM NGO 999.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 18-Mar-2013 :
The SRD acoustic gauge at Vigo has been moved and replaced by a new MIROS radar gauge. Both
old and new gauges were running for the period 20.11.2008-31.12.2009 for inter-comparison purposes.
A bias (mean difference) of -0.71cm was calculated. Hardware problems (de-lamination) were also initially experienced
at the new MIROS gauge this has been taken into account in the supplied data. See paper by B. Perez et al 'Overlapping
sea level time series measured using different technologies: an example from the REDMAR Spanish network'.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 13-Jan-2014 :
Further investigation by Puertos del Estado revealed the bias between old and new datasets was due to a problem with the old Acoustic gauge. Data from this was revised. Whole dataset has been re-entered onto the database.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 28-Apr-2014 :
At the request of Puertos del Estado the latitude and longitude have been changed from 42.250000 -8.733333 which was derived from the previously supplied degrees and minutes value to 42.24314 -8.72600 which is the position of the new MIROS gauge in decimal degrees.
