Princes stilling well gauge was maintained by the Mersey Docks and Hbr Board with chart reductions in later years by Bidston Observatory (POL)
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 21-SEP-94 :
At Princes there was  a Bailey gauge up to 17 July 1957 Kent gauge 31 December  - 12 January 1984 Lege gauge 13 October 1956 - 31 December 1974 NB some overlap of records - perhaps 2 wells but this is not clear

Following a review of all data from both Liverpool Georges Pier and Liverpool Princes Pier the two series have been combined. The data up to 1911 is from Georges Pier and for the years 1858-1901 was based on 24 readings per day; for 1903-1911 values were based on high and low water readings.  For Princes Pier the 1959-62 data was based on 8 readings per day; all data up to 1958 and since 1963 was based on 24 readings per day. Data 1903-11 are Mean Tide Level (MTL) which can be converted approx to MSL by subtracting 45mm (NOTE: value superseded in 26-Jan-2016 entry). Large values at the start of the Georges record have been blamed on excessive loading of the Georges landing stage - see references below

A value of MTL-MSL=65 mm has been applied to the RLR data for the period 1903-1911.  This value was derived by Philip Woodworth in preparation of his MTL/MSL manuscript.  In this case the values were derived using from the GESLA2 (high-frequency tide gauge) dataset using harmonic constituents.  Note that this value does differ from the value of 45 mm which had been previously listed in the 1999 entries.
