1969-1973 Data from readings of tide pole
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 11-JUN-91 :
Posidhonia          290/011 RLR(1981) is 8.6m below BM R67
=========================== BENCHMARK INFORMATION UPDATE ADDED  12-JUL-93 :
Posidhonia          290/011 RLR(1981) is 8.6m below BM R67
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 11-MAR-97 :
The contributing authority advises that anomalous values
are the result of met. influences
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 2000Jun14 :
Posidonia tide gauge malfunctioned 1994, repaired in 1999.
Data for 1994-6 deleted from database.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 2001May14 :
Data for 1999 onwards looks approx 0.3 m higher than pre-1994 data.
HNHS state that the gauge is operating normally and so it is
assumed that no datum change has occurred.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 28-Nov-2006 :
Station flagged and switched from RLR to 'Metric' because of datum anomaly.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 03-Mar-2011 :
After a review of the dataset it was decided that the data for October
1999-December 2002 be revised to RLR. Data for the period January 2003 onwards
when the method of data measured was changed has been relegated to 'Metric'.
However the station has been reinstated as RLR so that the 'good' RLR data is
visible on the website. The station remains flagged.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 13-Jul-2011 :
Following further information from the Hellenic Navy Oceanography Service a
datum adjustment was applied to the data for 2003 onwards. When plotted the
data now appears correct. RLR status has been reinstated and the station flag
removed.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 07-Aug-2013 :   
Following receipt of datum diagrams from the Hellenic Navy the RLR diagram has been re-drawn. In consequence both the RLR factors and the benchmark reference have changed.
