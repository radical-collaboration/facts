2007/8 one minute sea level data downloaded from the IOC Sea Level Station Monitoring Facility Ostend. This is then converted to 15min. data for processing. 2007/8 monthly and annual mean sea level values have now been extrapolated from the data. As the relationship for the prime bench mark remains the same there is no need to alter RLR. Details of the bench marks has been derived from site installation information. Copies of these have been included in the port files and RLR file for reference.
