1948 - 1958 VALUES BASED ON READINGS OF HIGH AND LOW WATERS
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 11-JUN-91 :
Diamond Harbour     500/131 RLR(1964) is 8.6m below BM 4/2
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 04-AUG-94 :
For a discussion of interannual variability of sea level along the coasts of Pakistan and India, see Clarke and Liu, Journal of Physical Oceanography, 24, 1224, 1994.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 2002Dec06 :
SMRC Newsletter Jul-Dec 2001 reports high E coast correlation with SOI and MSL. MSL is much higher during La Nina tropical cyclones than during El Nino.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 15-Sep-2010 :
The original datum and benchmark was BM 97 6.060m above the datum for 1881-1885. In 1948 the benchmark was changed to BM 4/2 4.869m above chart datum. In 1965 the benchmark was again changed to BM 2014 8.37m relative to chart datum. This remains the primary benchmark.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 13-Jan-2016 :
We have changed the first line above, indicating that the MTL ends in 1958, not 1956 as was previously stated.  We have verified that the values in the database are those from Pub. Sci. 20, in which they were indicated as MTL.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 22-Jan-2016 :   
A value of MTL-MSL=-49 mm has been applied to the RLR data for the period 1948-1958.  This value was derived from the average of three differences in the annual MSL and MTL listed for the station in Pub. Sci. 24.  Note that no correction has been applied to the metric data.
