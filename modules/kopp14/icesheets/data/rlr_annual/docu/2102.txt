=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 07-Dec-2011 :
Although the tide gauge at Skagsudde has been operating since 1982 this station has only just been added to the database. There are a total of 23 Swedish stations now on the database. Station is now also RLR. RLR factor is -1600.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 07-Apr-2015 :
The RLR diagram incorrectly referenced the tide gauge zero value to the benchmark rather than to the local height system. We have redrawn the RLR diagram and removed the reference to tide gauge zero.  The RLR height did change, but the RLR factor applied to the metric data did not change.
