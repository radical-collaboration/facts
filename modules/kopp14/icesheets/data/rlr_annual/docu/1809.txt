=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 2000Oct19 :
Bonanza new station 1992.  Data supplied by Climat Maritimo, Madrid.
RLR(1993) is 9.885m below BM NGU 76.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 25-Jan-2011 :
Bonanza now supplied by Puertos del Estado (PE). Station made RLR. RLR year
1993 factor 5.361m.Benchmark is NGU 76 4.524m above Redmar datum 3.105m above
IGN.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 09-Apr-2013 :
The old SRD acoustic gauge for Bonanza has been replaced by a new MIROS radar gauge . Both old and new gauges were run in parallel for the period 13.01.2010-13.11.2010 for inter-comparison purposes. A bias (mean difference) of 5.01cm between the two gauges was found as was a malfunction of the old sensor. See paper B. Perez et al 'Overlapping sea level time series measured using different technologies: an example from the REDMAR Spanish netwotk'
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 13-Jan-2014 :
Further investigation revealed that the bias between old and new datasets was due to a gauge fault int he old Acoustic gauge. Data from this was revised. Complete dataset has been re-entered onto the database.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 28-Apr-2014 :
At the request from Puertos del Estado the latitude and longitude have been changed from 36.800000 -6.333333 derived from the previously supplied degrees and minutes value to 36.80221 -6.33813 as this is the site of the new MIROS gauge in decimal degrees.
