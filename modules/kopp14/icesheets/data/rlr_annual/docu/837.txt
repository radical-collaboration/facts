It has been confirmed that the present dataset for Newcastle is a compendium of station 267 to the end of the record (December 1988) and then station 837 from January 1989 to present. Apparently both gauges were run in parallel for a number of years until station 837 was synched with the monthly records of station 267 when 837 became the primary gauge. See Phil Watson's letter of 25.10.10. The numbers have also been checked and the situation verified.
