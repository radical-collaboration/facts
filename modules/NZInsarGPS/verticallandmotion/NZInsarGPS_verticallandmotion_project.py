''' NZInsarGPS_project_verticallandmotion.py

This runs the projection stage for the vertical land motion component of the IPCC AR6
workflow.

Parameters:
pipeline_id = Unique identifier for the pipeline running this code

Note: This is currently a NULL process. Rates are already read in during the preprocess
stage.  Projections for individual locations and grid points are handled in
post-processing.
