Quick Start
===========

FACTS uses `RADICAL-EnsembleToolkit (EnTK) <https://radicalentk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ and `RADICAL-Pilot <https://radicalpilot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ to execute its modules. While the RADICAL tools are specifically designed for executing on a range of `supported <https://radicalpilot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/supported.html>`_ high performance computing (HPC) platforms, FACTS can also execute on a GNU/Linux workstation, virtual machine or container. Here we offer instructions for each deployment scenario but if you want to run FACTS at scale on an HPC platform, please `contact us <https://github.com/radical-collaboration/facts/issues/new>`_ and we will be happy to offer tailored support.

.. warning:: FACTS MUST be used within a dedicated Python virtual environment. You can use `venv`, `conda` or `virtualenv` to create one. If you try to install FACTS system-wide, it will fail.

Installing and Using FACTS on a GNU/Linux Workstation
-----------------------------------------------------

1. Clone the FACTS repository::

    git clone https://github.com/radical-collaboration/facts.git

2. Download modules-data from Zenodo::

    wget -P facts/modules-data -i facts/modules-data/modules-data.urls.txt

   As of December 2022, the data for stable FACTS modules are available on Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7478191 and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7478447 (note, split between
   two Zenodo entries because of size limitations). (If you have multiple users of FACTS, you might want to put
   these ~60 GB of files in a common location and soft-link to each user's directory.)

   Rather than installing the data files for all modules, some of which are many gigabytes in size, 
   you might wish to create a custom version of ``modules-data.urls.txt`` that includes only the data files for modules you intended to use.
   For example, if you are only planning on doing global projections with the modules used in the Kopp et al. (2023) manuscript, you
   could use the ``modules-data.global_only.urls.txt`` file instead::

    wget -P facts/modules-data -i facts/modules-data/modules-data.global_only.urls.txt

3. Create and activate a Python virtual environment, and install FACTS's Python dependences in it. You can use `venv`, `conda` or `virtualenv` to create your Python virtual environment. See `these instructions <https://radicalpilot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html#Installation>`_ for further details. Using `venv`::

    python3 -m venv ve3
    . ve3/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade setuptools pip wheel
    pip install -r facts/facts_requirments.txt

4. Test your install by running the dummy experiment::

    cd facts
    python3 runFACTS.py experiments/dummy

5. If you wish to run the ``emulandice`` module set, additional steps are necessary, as this module set is a wrapper around separately developed R code (see https://github.com/tamsinedwards/emulandice/). First, ensure R and cmake are installed. On Ubuntu, these are provided by the r-base and cmake packages. Then build ``emulandice`` and a tar file of its associated R dependencies::

    modules/emulandice/emulandice_config.sh

6. Create a new experiment. For example::

    mkdir test
    cp -r experiments/coupling.ssp585/config.yml test

7. Run your experiment::

    python3 runFACTS.py test


Note that all the input files for the experiment (which can be tens of GB if you are doing local sea-level projections that rely upon CMIP output) will get copied to a sandbox
created for each run. If you are running FACTS using localhost as a resource, this sandbox directory is ``~/radical.pilot.sandbox``. If you have space limits on your home directory, you may want to make this a symlink to a directory with fewer space limits prior to running FACTS. The task-level ``.out`` and ``.err`` files in the sandbox are key to debugging module-level code failures; thus, this sandbox is not deleted by default. However, if you wish to save space and do not need these files for debugging, you may wish to save space by deleting the subdirectories of the sandbox folder after each run.

Note that the data files for a FACTS experiment are transfered to the compute
resource with each experiment run. Thus, while it might in principle be possible
to run FACTS on your desktop and use a remote HPC resource, you probably don't
want to do this. Most likely, you want to install and run FACTS directly on the remote resource.
At a minimum, you will want to have a fast, high-capacity network connection to the resource.

If you need to run on a HPC resource not previously configured for RADICAL-Pilot (see the `RADICAL-Pilot documentation <https://radicalpilot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/supported.html>`_) ,
the resource will need to be configured. To get assistance with this, create an `issue <https://github.com/radical-cybertools/radical.pilot/issues>`_ on the RADICAL-Pilot repo.

Installing and Using FACTS on a GNU/Linux Container
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The RADICAL toolkit does not support MacOS or Windows. Therefore, to run on a Mac or Windows (the latter with WSL2), you need to run within a Linux virtual machine or container. 

We have provided a Docker container in the ``docker/`` directory. This container provides the Linux,
Python, R, and RADICAL toolkit environment needed for FACTS to run.
FACTS itself does not reside within the container because of needs related to
storage space for module data, persistence of changes, and writability. The instructions below
assume FACTS resides outside the container in ``$HOME/facts`` and mounts it within the container as
``/opt/facts``. At the moment, the docker environment appears to work fairly reliably when
using localhost as the resource, but working with remote resources will require additional configuration. 

The sandbox directory resides within the container at ``~/radical.pilot.sandbox``. You will likely wish to keep an eye on the size of this directory if you are doing runs that involve large files.

To install FACTS through Docker please follow the steps below:

1. Clone the FACTS repository::

    git clone https://github.com/radical-collaboration/facts.git

2. Download modules-data::

    wget -P facts/modules-data -i facts/modules-data/modules-data.urls.txt

3. Build the docker container::

    cd facts/docker
    sh develop.sh

4. Start a container from the ``facts`` image, assuming that the FACTS repository was cloned in ``$HOME/facts`` and will be mounted within the container as ``/opt/facts``::

    docker run -it --volume=$HOME/facts:/opt/facts -w /opt/facts facts

5. Confirm that FACTS work within the container::

    python3 runFACTS.py experiments/dummy

6. If you wish to use ``emulandice``, build ``emulandice`` and a tar file of its associated R dependencies::

    modules/emulandice/emulandice_config.sh

The Dockerfile also creates a ``facts-jupyter`` image, should you wish to run FACTS from a Jupyter notebook rather than the commandline. This Docker image can be launched::

     docker run -it --volume=$HOME/facts:/opt/facts -w /opt/facts -p 8888:8888 facts-jupyter jupyter lab  --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888

If you want to place the FACTS sandbox outside the container, whether to keep the space of the container smaller or to allow the sandbox to be preserved for inspection across docker runs, you can mount a target directory at /home/jovyan/radical.pilot.sandbox, e.g.::

    docker run -it --volume=$HOME/facts:/opt/facts --volume=$HOME/tmp/radical.pilot.sandbox:/home/jovyan/radical.pilot.sandbox -w /opt/facts facts


Testing a module with a shell script
------------------------------------

In some cases, particularly during module development, it may be desirable to call
a FACTS module outside the EnTK framework. This can be done using an experimental
shell-script writing feature in runFACTS. Performance is not guaranteed, and
multi-module experiments are very likely not to work without customization, as
module coupling within FACTS is handled by the EnTK framework. 

1. Create an experiment (e.g., ``experiments/onemodule``) that invokes only the module of interest.

2. Create a shell scripts that executes the experiment by calling ``runFACTS`` with the ``--shellscript`` argument. For example::

    python3 runFACTS.py --shellscript experiments/onemodule > test.sh
    
3. Execute the shell script. For example::

    source test.sh
